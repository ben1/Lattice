# Introduction

This is a small C/C++ app that brings together several opensource libraries for use as a starting point for prototyping or making simple games.

Libraries used are:
* SDL for graphics/audio
* Dear ImGui for UI
* FreeType for font rendering
* FastBuild for a build system as well as for many low level utilities:
    * containers / file / network / memory / profiling / testing / multi-threading / reflection.

OpenGL3 is the default rendering backend, but can be changed to anything SDL supports.

Everything is statically compiled, with unused functionality optimized out.

# Building

Currently Visual Studio on Windows is supported, but GCC/Clang/OSX/Linux would be easy to add.

## Visual Studio

1. To generate the solution, run:
> External\FastBuild\1.08\Bin\win32-x64\FBuild.exe solution

If the scripts failed to find  the locally installed versions of VS or WindowsSDK, the errors will tell you where in the script to set the path.

2. Open the solution in 'tmp\VisualStudio' and hit F5.

If new files are added to the project outside of Visual Studio, the solution can be regenerated by building the Build\UpdateSolution project.

# License

Each library inside the 'External' folder has its own license which must be adhered to.

The build files were based on build files from FastBuild, and the Main.cpp was copied and modified from the example in imgui.

Other code is covered by the 'LICENSE.TXT' in this folder.
